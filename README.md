# Decision-Tree-Classifier-Model
Here, Lies An easy programming code to make a Decision Tree classifier model using sci-kit learn library in Python.
The data used is of iris flower data. You could import this data from **sci-kit learn datasets**, as shown in the code.
# Features
The model uses concept of **Decision-tree** to label the flower data into three sets of flower species. The model is trained all over the data, and has given **100% accuracy** and You could also find the Decision-Tree plot at the end.
